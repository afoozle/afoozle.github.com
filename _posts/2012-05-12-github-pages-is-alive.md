Well this is my first foray into both github pages and into jekyll powered blogs. So far so good but it
remains to be seen whether this will be a good way to manage blog content going forward.

I can certainly see the benefit to being able to create posts via markdown and push them up with git
commits as it fits in with my workflow nicely.
